Please try and finish step 1 before the start of our session.

### `Step 1 - Project Setup`

Make sure you have NodeJS installed on your local computer.

[Visit this link](https://nodejs.org/en/) and download the latest NodeJS version.

After you have it installed, navigate to this project's directory in your terminal or shell and then run:

```
npm install
```

After all dependencies are installed, run:

```
npm start
```

This will run the app in the development mode and will automatically open it on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits to the code in the project.

### `Step 2 - Interview Code Along`

Tasks to complete:

- Style the form elements - user name and job fields, button and overall form

- Hook up both input elements so user can type

- Hook up submit button so when its clicked, it posts user's name and his job to `https://reqres.in/api/users` and print the response to the console
